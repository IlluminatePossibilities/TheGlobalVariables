### About Diversity Cyber Council
#### Site
https://diversitycybercouncil.com/ (fixme link)

#### Mission
Diversity Cyber Council is a 501c3 Non-Profit that serves under-represented demographics in the tech industry by facilitating education, training, and staffing opportunities to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline to the workforce.

### Vision
Our vision is to enhance inclusion and representation in the tech industry through training, mentoring, networking, and visibility programs.

### Kata Project Goal
Our goal is to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline that extends career equity to underrepresented demographics by providing access to competent training programs that lead to direct employment opportunities. 

## Kata Program

### Program Name
Spotlight App/Platform

### Program Summary
The Spotlight App Project is a sustained effort to amass a coalition of nonprofits in order to address specific needs within the communities we serve by leveraging a centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact. 												
Problem Statement #1: The decentralization and lack of support between nonprofits create gaps of service and overall impact. 												
Problem Statement #2: The lack of visibility of nonprofit groups and offerings creates a barrier of access to the people we aim to serve.
