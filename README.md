### About Diversity Cyber Council

#### Mission
Diversity Cyber Council is a 501c3 Non-Profit that serves under-represented demographics in the tech industry by facilitating education, training, and staffing opportunities to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline to the workforce.

Our vision is to enhance inclusion and representation in the tech industry through training, mentoring, networking, and visibility programs.

Our goal is to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline that extends career equity to underrepresented demographics by providing access to competent training programs that lead to direct employment opportunities. 

## Kata Program

### Program Name
Spotlight App/Platform

### Program Summary
The Spotlight App Project is a sustained effort to amass a coalition of nonprofits in order to address specific needs within the communities we serve by leveraging a centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact. 												
Problem Statement #1: The decentralization and lack of support between nonprofits create gaps of service and overall impact. 												
Problem Statement #2: The lack of visibility of nonprofit groups and offerings creates a barrier of access to the people we aim to serve.
